Hi! I'm leovalentin.

I am currently studying my second year of engineering in IT. On this github I will be posting several of my previous projects that I have done either in school,
or during my spare time. This github will reflect my personel intrests in coding, web development, microcontrollers and gamedesign.

ðŸ“« If you have any questions regarding my projects or wish to contact me about something else, you can reach me through mail on leoakerberg@gmail.com.
